# vue-typescript-starter

This project is a custom Vue 3 template with TypeScript already set up. 

It contains the auto-generated tutorial files which usually generate using `npm create vue@latest`.  

*Please note that this project is set up according to official guidelines at [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html), 
but also my personal preferences as someone coming from Angular.*
